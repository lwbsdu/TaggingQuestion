80,26,2008-08-01T13:57:07Z,NA,26,SQLStatement.execute() - multiple queries in one statement,"<p>I've written a database generation script in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"">SQL</a> and want to execute it in my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime"">Adobe AIR</a> application:</p>

<pre><code>Create Table tRole (
      roleID integer Primary Key
      ,roleName varchar(40)
);
Create Table tFile (
    fileID integer Primary Key
    ,fileName varchar(50)
    ,fileDescription varchar(500)
    ,thumbnailID integer
    ,fileFormatID integer
    ,categoryID integer
    ,isFavorite boolean
    ,dateAdded date
    ,globalAccessCount integer
    ,lastAccessTime date
    ,downloadComplete boolean
    ,isNew boolean
    ,isSpotlight boolean
    ,duration varchar(30)
);
Create Table tCategory (
    categoryID integer Primary Key
    ,categoryName varchar(50)
    ,parent_categoryID integer
);
...
</code></pre>

<p>I execute this in Adobe AIR using the following methods:</p>

<pre><code>public static function RunSqlFromFile(fileName:String):void {
    var file:File = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath(fileName);
    var stream:FileStream = new FileStream();
    stream.open(file, FileMode.READ)
    var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);
    NonQuery(strSql);
}

public static function NonQuery(strSQL:String):void
{
    var sqlConnection:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection();
    sqlConnection.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(DBPATH);
    var sqlStatement:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement();
    sqlStatement.text = strSQL;
    sqlStatement.sqlConnection = sqlConnection;
    try
    {
        sqlStatement.execute();
    }
    catch (error:SQLError)
    {
        Alert.show(error.toString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>No errors are generated, however only <code>tRole</code> exists. It seems that it only looks at the first query (up to the semicolon- if I remove it, the query fails). Is there a way to call multiple queries in one statement?</p>

<p>All the better if it's specific to TortoiseSVN client.</p>

260,91,2008-08-01T23:22:08Z,NA,49,Adding scripting functionality to .NET applications,"<p>I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's 
a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game"">trading card game</a>, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, <code>ICard</code>, which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p>

<p>Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p>

<p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.</p>

<pre><code>ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();
Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);
</code></pre>

<p>The language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.</p>

330,63,2008-08-02T02:51:36Z,NA,29,Should I use nested classes in this case?,"<p>I am working on a collection of classes used for video playback and recording. I have one main class which acts like the public interface, with methods like <code>play()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, <code>pause()</code>, <code>record()</code> etc... Then I have workhorse classes which do the video decoding and video encoding. </p>

<p>I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p>

<p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

I've seen numerous examples where there is homegrown code for consuming the service as opposed to using the auto generated methods Visual Studio creates when adding the web reference. </p>

<p>Is there some advantage to this?</p>

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>
